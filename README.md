# Acoustic Signal Based Bearing Fault Analysis of Three Phase Induction Motor

## Abstract
This project investigates the detection of faulty bearings in three-phase induction motors using acoustic signal analysis. The analysis is conducted under half-load and full-load conditions to evaluate the health of rotating machines. Various signal processing techniques such as time-domain and frequency-domain analysis, including Peak Amplitude, Kurtosis, Envelope Analysis, and Dominant Frequency, are used to distinguish between healthy and faulty bearings. The outcomes contribute to the field of signal processing for machinery diagnosis and the development of embedded fault detection systems.
